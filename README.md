# `demcmc-fip`

This repository contains scripts for estimating the first ionisation potential bias (FIP bias) using [demcmc](https://demcmc.readthedocs.io) to do the differential emission measure (DEM) calculations.
The scripts here are designed to be run on [Myriad](https://www.rc.ucl.ac.uk/docs/Clusters/Myriad/), one of the high performance computing systems at University College London (UCL).
It shouldn't be too hard to adapt them to work elsewhere.
